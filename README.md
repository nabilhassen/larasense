## Usage

1.  Start by creating an admin user by running: `php artisan make:admin`.
2.  Navigate to `/admin` path and use the credentials from step 1 to login to filament admin panel.
3.  Once logged in, navigate to the Publishers page in the sidebar and create a new publisher.
    -   **Make sure the "Allow Publisher" and "Track Publisher" toggles are turned ON.**
4.  Next, go to the Sources page in the sidebar and create a source associated with the publisher you just added **(one source is enough)**.
    -   Example Source 1:
        -   RSS URL: https://nabilhassen.com/feed
        -   Type: Article
    -   Example Source 2:
        -   RSS URL: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC5vAu93DnzOS6LLDnHA9SfQ
        -   Type: Youtube
    -   **Make sure the "Track Source" and "Allow Source" toggles are turned ON.**
5.  In a separate terminal, trigger the content collection bot by running: `php artisan larasense:bot`. It pushes jobs to the queue to pull content from the source(s) you created.
6.  Start the queue worker: `php artisan queue:listen`
7.  Navigate to `/home` path in your browser to explore the collected content.
